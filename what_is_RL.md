# Book Review

# Introduce
RL means Reinforcement Learning which is recently used for Deep Learning.

This book introduced about Reinforcement Learning with Python and Keras.

First, you should know to understand Python, the perfect programming language.

In Python, we can make a game, application(app), even control Hardware such as FPGA board(ex. PYNQ by AMD).

Especially, Python has strength about Deep learning.

How about Keras, did you heard this word?

Keras is a tool to help deep learning skill.

# Reinforcement learning has trial and error
